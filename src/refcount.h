/*
 * We need two counters to keep track of referenced objects: one for when an
 * object is also resposible for preserving all its children, and one for
 * when that is not the case.
 *
 * The former is called `_recursive_count` and the latter is `_direct_count`.
 *
 * Most of the time it is the `_recursive_count` that is interesting. For
 * example, having nodes such as
 *
 *                            N
 *                           ðŸ¡— ðŸ¡–
 *                          M   K
 *
 * then deleting N would decrement the `_recursive_count` and if it ends up
 * being zero, then it tries to delete M and K as well.
 *
 * However, we can only use `_recursive_count` for nodes whose all descendants
 * we have. We call these nodes "complete".
 *
 * We can also have "incomplete" nodes because objects are loaded from the
 * network one by one and we need to preserve these as well. To do so, we
 * increase their `_direct_count`.
